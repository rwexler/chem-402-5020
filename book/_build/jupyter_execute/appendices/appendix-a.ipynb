    "## Exact Differentials vs. State Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a subtle distinction between an exact differential and a state variable that's worth considering. Formally, we say that \"a state variable has an exact differential.\" Alternatively, \"the differential of a state variable is exact.\" For instance, if we compress a balloon infinitesimally ($dV_m$) while slowly moving it toward a heat source ($dT$), the pressure $P$ would change by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "dP = \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V_m} \\right)_T dV_m + \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{V_m} dT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates how the value of a state variable $P$ shifts in response to tiny changes in its independent variables. In short, while it's correct to say \"$dP$ is exact (not $P$) because $P$ is a state variable,\" it's more logically precise to note that \"$P$ is a state variable because $dP$ is exact.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exact vs. Inexact Differentials\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, we encounter both exact and inexact differentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exact differentials**: These have equal mixed partial derivatives and integrate to a unique function (for example, $dU$ for the internal energy $U$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inexact differentials**: These have unequal mixed partial derivatives and do not integrate to a single function (examples include the differentials for heat and work).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of seeking a method to convert an inexact differential into an exact one is a key step in the derivation of entropy. In fact, by applying an integrating factor—in this case, $1/T$—we can transform the inexact differential of heat $\\delta q$ into the exact differential $dS = \\delta q/T$. This approach was central to the original formulation of entropy."
