    "## Overview\n",

    "## Foundational Assumptions of Kinetic Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large Number of Particles**:\n",
    "   A gas consists of a statistically large number of identical particles in isotropic random motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Point Particles**:\n",
    "   The size of the particles is negligible compared to the average distance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Collisions**:\n",
    "   Collisions between particles and with the container walls (a type of boundary) are perfectly elastic, conserving both momentum and kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Interparticle Forces**:\n",
    "   Particles do not exert forces on one another, except during collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Classical Mechanics Applies**:\n",
    "   Particle motion follows Newton’s second law, $\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a}$.\n",
    "   <!-- Particle motion follows Newton’s second law, $\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a}$, where $\\vec{F}$ is the net force on the particle, $m$ is its mass, and $\\vec{a}$ is its acceleration. -->\n",

    "Pressure is defined as the force exerted per unit area. At the microscopic scale, pressure arises from particles colliding with the container walls. Each collision exerts a force, and the cumulative effect of countless microscopic collisions produces macroscopic pressure.\n",
