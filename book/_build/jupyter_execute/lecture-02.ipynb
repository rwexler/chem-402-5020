    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetic theory explains the macroscopic properties of gases—such as pressure and temperature—by describing the microscopic motion of particles. This lecture examines the foundational assumptions, derivation of fundamental equations, and the physical significance of kinetic theory.\n",

    "## Foundational Assumptions of Kinetic Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large Number of Particles**:\n",
    "   A gas consists of a statistically large number of identical particles in isotropic random motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Point Particles**:\n",
    "   The size of the particles is negligible compared to the average distance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Collisions**:\n",
    "   Collisions between particles and with the container walls (a type of boundary) are perfectly elastic, conserving both momentum and kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Interparticle Forces**:\n",
    "   Particles do not exert forces on one another, except during collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Classical Mechanics Applies**:\n",
    "   Particle motion follows Newton's second law:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```{math}\n",
    "   \\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt},\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $\\vec{F}$ is the net force acting on a particle, $\\vec{p}$ is the linear momentum of the particle, and $t$ is time.\n",
