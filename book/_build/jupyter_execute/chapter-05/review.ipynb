    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     with natural variables $\\left(T,V\\right)$. At fixed temperature and volume, a process is spontaneous if $\\Delta A<0$.\n",
    "   - **Gibbs Free Energy**\n",
    "     Defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```{math}\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     with natural variables $\\left(T,P\\right)$. At constant $T,P$, spontaneity requires $\\Delta G<0$, and $\\Delta G=0$ marks equilibrium.\n",

    "2. **The Third Law of Thermodynamics**\n",
    "   - **Planck’s Statement**:\n",

    "   - **Boltzmann’s View**:\n",
    "     $S = k_B\\ln\\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the count of microstates. A perfect crystal has $\\Omega=1$ at 0 K.\n",
    "   - **Residual Entropy**:\n",
    "     Real crystals often contain equivalent configurations (e.g., orientational disorder in solid CO), giving a nonzero “residual” $S(0)$. Example: $S_\\text{res}=k_B\\ln2$ per molecule.\n",
