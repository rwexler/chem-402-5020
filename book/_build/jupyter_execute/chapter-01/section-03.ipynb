    "Ideal gases are a central model in thermodynamics. By simplifying microscopic interactions and treating molecules as non-interacting point particles, we can accurately predict many macroscopic properties for gases under appropriate conditions. This section reviews the classical gas laws, derives the ideal gas equation of state, and discusses the assumptions underlying the ideal gas model.\n",

Above, each gas law relates *two* state variables (among $P, V, T, N$) under conditions where two other variables remain constant. To derive a single equation of state that relates *all* four variables, we can combine these laws and use multivariate calculus (as covered in [Math 233](https://math.wustl.edu/calculus-iii)).\n",
