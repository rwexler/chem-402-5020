    "This course explores the core concepts of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics as well as their applications in chemical systems. Building on prior knowledge of thermodynamic principles (covered in [Chem 106](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/chemistry-105-106) and [Chem 112](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/chemistry-111-112)) and quantum mechanics (covered in [Chem 105](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/chemistry-105-106), [Chem 111](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/chemistry-111-112), and [Chem 401](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/physical-chemistry-i)), this course prepares students to connect molecular behavior to macroscopic thermodynamics, bridging theory and real-world contexts.\n",
