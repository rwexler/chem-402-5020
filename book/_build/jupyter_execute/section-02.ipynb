    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetic theory connects the microscopic motion of gas particles to macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature. This section introduces the fundamental assumptions of kinetic theory, derives key equations, and highlights their physical relevance.\n",

    "## Foundational Assumptions of Kinetic Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large Number of Particles**:\n",
    "   A gas contains a very large number of identical particles moving randomly in all directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Point Particles**:\n",
    "   Each particle's size is negligible compared to the average distance between particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Collisions**:\n",
    "   Collisions between particles, and between particles and the container walls, conserve both momentum and kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Long-Range Interparticle Forces**:\n",
    "   Particles do not exert forces on one another except when they collide (i.e., there are no long-range attractive or repulsive forces).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Classical Mechanics Applies**:\n",
    "   Particle motion follows Newton's second law:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```{math}\n",
    "   \\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt},\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $\\vec{F}$ is the net force on a particle, $\\vec{p}$ is its linear momentum, and $t$ is time.\n",
