    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sections 2.2 and 2.3, we derived the canonical partition function and the ensemble averages for systems of one particle. In this section, we extend these concepts to closed systems of **many identical and independent particles with internal degrees of freedom**. We will also introduce the concept of **indistinguishability**, which is central to the statistical mechanics of quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**Assumption (Single Occupancy):**\n",
    "Throughout this section, we assume that each one‐particle microstate can be occupied by **at most one** particle. Under this assumption, the total number of ways to place $N$ distinguishable particles in $M$ one‐particle microstates is $\\tfrac{M!}{(M-N)!}$ rather than $M^N$. If multiple occupancy were allowed, the counting would differ accordingly (e.g., $M^N$ for unlimited occupancy).\n",
