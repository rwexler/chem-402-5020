    "# 2.3. Ensemble Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 2.1, we introduced the concept that *macroscopic properties are expected values of microscopic properties*, emphasizing that these expected values account for the probabilities of different microstates. In Section 2.2, we derived the probability distribution (in the canonical ensemble) for a closed system’s microstates. Now, in this section, we connect these ideas to calculate **ensemble averages** that determine macroscopic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thermodynamic Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Section 1.1 that **thermodynamic equilibrium** is a state of simultaneous mechanical, thermal, and chemical equilibrium. Below are definitions of each type of equilibrium:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{glossary}\n",
    "Thermal contact\n",
    "    A state in which two systems can exchange energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical contact\n",
    "    A state in which two systems can exchange matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanical equilibrium\n",
    "    A state where the net force on every particle in the system is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal equilibrium\n",
    "    A state where there is no net exchange of energy between systems in thermal contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical equilibrium\n",
    "    A state where there is no net exchange of matter between systems in chemical contact.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "The **internal energy** $U$ of a macroscopic system at thermodynamic equilibrium is defined as the ensemble average $\\langle E \\rangle$ of the total microscopic energy $E$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "U \\;=\\; \\langle E \\rangle \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^M E_i\\,p_i,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_i$ is the energy of microstate $i$, $p_i$ is the probability of that microstate, and $M$ is the total number of microstates.\n",

    "Since $Q$ is defined at fixed $N, V,$ and $T$, it does not depend on the microstate index $i$. Consequently, $Q$ behaves as a constant with respect to the summation over $i$.\n",
