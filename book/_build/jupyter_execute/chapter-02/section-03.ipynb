    "# 2.3. Ensemble Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 2.1, we introduced the idea that \"macroscopic properties are expected values of microscopic properties,\" where expected values account for the probabilities of different microstates. In Section 2.2, we derived the probability (density function) of finding a closed system in a particular microstate. In this section, we will combine these concepts to calculate macroscopic properties from expected values of microscopic properties, which we will refer to as **ensemble averages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thermodynamic Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 1.1, we defined **thermodynamic equilibrium** as \"a state of simultaneous mechanical, thermal, and chemical equilibrium.\" We will now define mechanical, thermal, and chemical equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{glossary}\n",
    "Thermal contact\n",
    "    A state in which two systems in contact can exchange energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical contact\n",
    "    A state in which two systems in contact can exchange matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanical equilibrium\n",
    "    A state in which the net force on all particles in a system is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal equilibrium\n",
    "    A state in which the net exchange of energy between all systems in thermal contact is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical equilibrium\n",
    "    A state in which the net exchange of matter between all systems in chemical contact is zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal energy $U$ of a macroscopic system in thermodynamic equilibrium is defined as the ensemble average $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ of the total energy $E$ of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "U \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_{i = 1}^M E_i p_i\n",
    "```\n",

    "where $E_i$ is the energy of microstate $i$ and $p_i$ is the probability of finding the system in microstate $i$. Substituting the probability (density function) for the canonical ensemble (i.e., the canonical distribution) from Section 2.2, we get\n",

    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Why can we factor out the partition function?\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "Since the partition function is defined at constant number of particles, volume, and temperature, it does not depend on the (microstate) index of summation. Therefore, the partition function is a constant and can be factored out of the sum.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Partial Derivative of the Partition Function with Respect to $\\beta$\n",
