    "\n",
    "Consider an ensemble of $\\mathcal{A}$ closed systems exchanging energy with a heat bath at temperature $T$. A heat bath is an environment that can absorb or release energy without changing its temperature because it is much larger than the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} How Can an Environment Absorb or Release Energy Without Changing Its Temperature?\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "The key point is that the temperature of a collection of particles is determined by the average kinetic energy per particle. According to the equipartition theorem, for particles with three translational degrees of freedom the total kinetic energy is\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "E_{\\text{kin}} = \\frac{3}{2} N\\, k_\\text{B}\\, T.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for a fixed amount of energy transfer, the corresponding change in temperature is given by\n",

    "\\Delta T = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{\\Delta E_\\text{kin}}{N\\, k_\\text{B}}.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the environment has many more particles than the system ($N_\\text{env} \\gg N_\\text{sys}$), the same amount of energy $\\Delta E$ will result in a much smaller $\\Delta T$ for the environment. In our example, even though the system (with $N_\\text{sys} = 6.022\\times10^{23}$ particles) absorbs energy and its temperature increases from 300 K to 400 K, the environment (with $N_\\text{env} = 6.022\\times10^{24}$ particles, i.e. 10 times as many) loses the same amount of energy per mole but its temperature only drops from 400 K to 390 K.\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates that an environment (or heat bath) can absorb or release energy almost isothermally because its very large number of particles (and hence its high heat capacity) means that the fractional change in average kinetic energy per particle is negligible—even though energy is being exchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, even though the total kinetic energy of the universe (system plus environment) remains constant, the environment's temperature barely changes because any energy loss or gain is diluted among a huge number of particles.\n",

At the higher elevation, the raindrop has more gravitational potential energy, making that state less favorable. Consequently, the raindrop is more likely to be found at the lower elevation, where its gravitational potential energy is reduced. In essence, systems tend to \"prefer\" lower energy states, which is why, on a macroscopic scale, water naturally flows downhill.\n",
