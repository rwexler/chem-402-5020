    "# 4.1. Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 3, we established the foundations of thermodynamics and explored the concept of enthalpy. We will learn that **exothermicity** (a negative enthalpy change) often favors spontaneity but does not fully determine it. The missing piece is **entropy**, a state function that provides crucial insight into the direction of spontaneous change. In this sub-module, we build on those ideas by formally introducing entropy, examining its definition, and understanding its role in the **arrow of time** for spontaneous processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exothermicity and Spontaneity\n",
    "\n",
    "Exothermic reactions are often—but not always—spontaneous. An exothermic process releases heat to its surroundings, corresponding to a negative enthalpy change, $\\Delta H < 0$. While this heat release can drive a process forward, enthalpy alone does not guarantee spontaneity; we must also consider entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "$\\Delta H < 0$ is **exothermic**  \n",
    "$\\Delta H > 0$ is **endothermic**\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example: Formation of Liquid Water\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the formation of two moles of liquid water from hydrogen and oxygen gases at 298.15 K and 1 bar:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\ce{2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(l)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard enthalpy change for this reaction is $-571.66$ kJ for two moles of H$_2$O(l), indicating an exothermic process. The reaction releases heat:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exothermicity in Chemical Terms\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "In chemical terms, **exothermicity** is often associated with the formation of stronger chemical bonds in the products than those in the reactants. In this example, forming $\\ce{H-O}$ bonds in water releases more energy than what was required to break $\\ce{H-H}$ and $\\ce{O=O}$ bonds.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fortunate that water formation is exothermic, as this makes the reaction more likely to proceed spontaneously under standard conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Counter Example: Mixing of Two Ideal Gases\n",
    "\n",
    "If we mix two ideal gases, such as Ar and Kr, their intermolecular interactions are negligible (ideal-gas behavior), so $\\Delta H = 0$. Nonetheless, mixing occurs spontaneously once the partition is removed."
