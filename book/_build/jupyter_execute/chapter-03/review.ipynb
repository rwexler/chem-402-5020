    "## 1. Checklist of Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3.1: Conservation of Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overview**\n",
    "   - Energy conservation underlies all of thermodynamics.\n",
    "   - Early demonstrations (e.g., Bernoulli, Euler) merged Newton’s mechanics with the idea that total mechanical energy remains constant in an isolated system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mechanical Equivalent of Heat**\n",
    "   - Joule’s experiments showed that mechanical work can be converted into heat in a fixed, quantitative ratio.\n",
    "   - For water: $\\text{MEH} \\approx 4.18\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}^{-1}$, establishing heat as another form of energy transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **First Law of Thermodynamics**\n",
    "   - Statement: $\\Delta U = q + w$, where $q$ is heat **absorbed by** the system, $w$ is work **done on** the system.\n",
    "   - **Path vs. State Functions**: $U$ is a state function (depends only on the current state), while $q$ and $w$ are path functions (depend on how the process is carried out).\n",
    "   - **Sign Convention**: in chemistry, $w>0$ if work is done **on** the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Types of Work**\n",
    "   - Generalized form: $\\delta w = \\text{(generalized force)} \\times \\text{(generalized displacement)}$.\n",
    "   - Common examples in thermodynamics:\n",
    "     - **$P\\,dV$ work**: compression/expansion of a gas ($\\delta w = -P\\,dV$).\n",
    "     - **Surface tension**: $\\delta w = -\\gamma\\,dA$.\n",
    "     - **Hooke’s law**: $\\delta w = k\\,(x - x_0)\\,dx$.\n",
    "   - Example calculations:\n",
    "     - Expansion against constant pressure.\n",
    "     - Inflating a bubble with surface tension.\n",
    "     - Stretching a spring-like fiber obeying Hooke’s law.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3.2: Applications of the First Law\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thermodynamic Processes**\n",
    "   - **Quasi-static**: carried out slowly enough for the system to remain in (near) equilibrium at each step.\n",
    "   - **Reversible**: idealized, quasi-static + no dissipative losses; can be undone with no net change in system or surroundings.\n",
    "   - **Irreversible**: any real process that breaks one or more reversibility conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How to Apply the First Law**\n",
    "   - **Stepwise Procedure**:\n",
    "     1. Choose two independent variables (e.g., $V, T$ or $P, T$).\n",
    "     2. Rewrite $\\delta q$ and $\\delta w$ in terms of differentials of those variables.\n",
    "     3. Apply relevant constraints (e.g., isobaric, isochoric, isothermal, adiabatic).\n",
    "     4. Use the system’s equation of state (e.g., $PV=nRT$ for an ideal gas).\n",
    "     5. Integrate or sum changes to find total $q$, $w$, and $\\Delta U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using $V$ and $T$ as Independent Variables**\n",
    "   - **First Law**: $\\delta q = dU + P\\,dV$.\n",
    "   - For an ideal gas ($\\partial U/\\partial V)_T = 0$):\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```{math}\n",
    "       \\delta q \n",
    "       = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V dT + P\\,dV.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Special processes:\n",
    "     - **Isochoric** ($dV=0$): $q = \\int C_V\\,dT$.\n",
    "     - **Isothermal** ($dT=0$): $q = \\int P\\,dV = nRT \\ln(V_2/V_1)$.\n",
    "     - **Adiabatic** ($q=0$): $\\Delta U = w$. For a monoatomic ideal gas, $T\\,V^{\\tfrac{2}{3}}=\\text{const}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Microscopic Interpretation**\n",
    "   - **Internal Energy**: $U = \\sum_i p_i E_i$.\n",
    "   - **Heat ($q$)** changes probabilities $p_i$.\n",
    "   - **Work ($w$)** shifts the energy levels $E_i$ themselves (e.g., compressing the container changes spacing of quantum states).\n",
    "   - This perspective unifies macroscopic thermodynamics with microscopic statistical mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3.3: Enthalpy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition of Enthalpy**\n",
    "   - $H = U + PV$.\n",
    "   - For a process at constant pressure, $\\delta q_P = dH$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **$\\Delta H$ and Heat at Constant Pressure**\n",
    "   - $\\Delta H = q_P$. Calorimetry at $P=\\text{const}$ measures enthalpy changes directly.\n",
    "   - **Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure**: $C_P = \\bigl(\\tfrac{\\partial H}{\\partial T}\\bigr)_P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Enthalpies**\n",
    "   - **Standard State**: $P^\\circ=1\\text{ bar}$; tabulated data often at $298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n",
    "   - **Standard Enthalpy of Formation**, $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$: enthalpy change to form 1 mole of a compound from its elements in their standard states.\n",
    "     - By convention, $\\Delta H_f^\\circ=0$ for any element in its standard state.\n",
    "   - **Standard Enthalpy of Reaction**, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{rxn}}^\\circ$:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```{math}\n",
    "       \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{rxn}}^\\circ\n",
    "       \\;=\\;\\sum_{\\text{products}} \\nu_p H_p^\\circ \n",
    "       \\;-\\;\\sum_{\\text{reactants}} \\nu_r H_r^\\circ.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Hess’s Law**: enthalpy changes are path independent; $\\Delta H$ of an overall reaction is the algebraic sum of enthalpy changes for its steps.\n",
