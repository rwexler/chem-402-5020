    "This section explores how to apply the First Law of Thermodynamics to various thermodynamic processes. We begin by clarifying key process definitions, then outline a step-by-step method for using the First Law under different constraints, and end with a microscopic interpretation that connects probability distributions of microstates with heat exchange.\n",
