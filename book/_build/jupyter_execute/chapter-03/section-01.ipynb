    "## Conservation of Mechanical Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 1732 and 1736, Bernoulli and Euler combined the discoveries of Newton (laws of motion) and Leibniz (the connection between weight × vertical displacement and weight × velocity squared) into an early form of the law of conservation of mechanical energy. A simple example is the interchange between potential and kinetic energy:\n",

    "During the Apollo 15 mission, astronaut David Scott famously dropped a hammer and a feather on the Moon. With negligible air resistance, both hit the ground simultaneously. This illustrates that in free fall, all objects (no matter their mass) accelerate at the same rate, and thus gain the same velocity over the same drop distance:\n",

    "In 1847, James Prescott Joule measured how mechanical work converts into heat. He famously found that dropping a total of $778$ lb$\\cdot$ft of weight (e.g., by turning a paddle in water) raised the temperature of $1$ lb of water by $1\\,^\\circ\\text{F}$. Converting to SI units:\n",
